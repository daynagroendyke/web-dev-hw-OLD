# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Dayna Groendyke
<p>Hello, my name is Dayna. I am taking this class because it is *required* to complete my degree. However, I am also taking it because it is so **helpful** in my career. I am currently in business development for a software company. In my role I am responsible for many projects. I am currently spearheading a templated email project as an initiative to increase productivity within the sales department. These templates are built in *salesforce.com* and do require some markdown to look professional. When it comes to building these templates I work closely with the Sales Ops manager, for technical questions related to the functionality of the CRM *(or SRM depending on who you talk to)*. But, when it comes to building the markup for the templates, and the copy themselves- that is my area. I think having a strong knowlege of web development will help me to iron out the aesthetic issues that I have been encountering while building these templates. So, beyond completing my degree- my goal here is to improve my output at work.</p>
### But, what exactly is the internet?
* Something that a squirrel can eat *(weird right)*
* The internet is built from fiberoptic cables that span across the ocean. **Fascinating, I know.**
* The first live website was built by the same company that created the large hadron collider *(say whaat?)*
* This company is called CERN, not to be confused with Cerf. Which is the last name of Vint, one of the developers of **Arpanet**. Arpanet was the first stage in what would eventually become the internet, and was a project under the Department of Defense.
* Bob Kahn is the other guy, who worked with Vint Cerf to build what we know as the net.
* The net is a large network of "independtently routed networks." Packets are routed through this network, and that is hour computers communicate with each other.
