# Assignment 2

<p>A version control system allows to make changes and file and track these changes over time. This way if you find that you dont like a change that has been made you can go back to a previous version of the project, instead of reworking the entire change. Version control is helpful for collaboration so that if someone makes a change that is incorrect or needs to be chansged there is a working record of the previous version of the files. This helps with collaboration and conflict management. We are using one in this class because it is an industry standard and it is helpful to have a working knowlege of this process for future work projects.</p>
